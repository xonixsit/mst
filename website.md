Retirement Planning

A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. It lets workers save and invest a piece of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. Taxes aren't paid until the money is withdrawn from the account.
You can contribute to 401(K) either individually or as part of an organization. 401(K) provided by an employer makes for a great starting platform for a retirement plan. Most of the for-profit organizations provide their employees with 401(K). Teachers and employees of other non-profit organizations have 403(b) instead of it.
401(k) allows you to save up to $18000 of your pre-tax income. And the best part is, if you change your organization, you can carry over the 401(k) to the new employer. As a sole proprietor, you can set up an individual account where you pay for both the employer as well as employee contributions. It is commonly known as solo 401(k).
